          As most personal homepages go, mine also does not come with any guarantee of frequent updates. In fact,
          deciding what to put on my homepage was always a struggle. I started blogging in 2020 and have now moved
          my blog posts here. Before that, the only surviving material was a collection of interesthing
          <a href="/links">things I found online</a>. I've found dozens of interesting things online every single
          day since I connected to the internet. The criteria for the few things on this list is that they stayed.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this January 2022 version of my homepage, for the first time in the page's history, it comes with
          easily accessible syntax highlighting of code, as well as MathJax equations. These were features I made
          for another website, but realising how cool this is, I want to celebrate by posting a random equation
          from <a href="http://www.elegantcoding.com/2011/11/eleven-equations-true-computer-science.html">11
            computer science equations</a> on the Elegant Coding blog:
        </p>

        $$ H(X) = E_X[I(x)] = - \sum_{i}^n P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i) $$

        <p>
          ... which is a definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">entropy</a>.
          I will use the opportunity to segway into cool stuff I found online by first mentioning Asimov's
          <a href="https://physics.princeton.edu/ph115/LQ.pdf">The Last Question</a> (1956).
